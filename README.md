## Package description
This project is a layered path planner algorithm to solve multiple agents navigation problem in a cluttered environment.

The general path planning problem is divided into approximate global trajectory construction, which is further smoothed by a local path planning method.
The proposed approach provides a solution based on a leader-followers architecture with a prescribed formation geometry that adapts dynamically to the environment and avoids collisions.

The path generated by the global planner based on rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm is corrected with the artificial potential fields (APF) method that ensures robots trajectories to be collision-free, reshaping the geometry of the formation when required by environmental conditions.

In order to run a simulator:
```bash
python scripts/layered_planner/layered_planner_sim.py 
```

When dealing with real robots (nano-quadrotors, Crazyflies):
- laucnh external position estimator (Vicon motion capture system), and connect to drones:
```bash
roslaunch adaptive_swarm connect123.launch
```
- and command the drones to fly in a formation through a map of obstacles:
```bash
rosrun adaptive_swarm layered_planner.py 
```
